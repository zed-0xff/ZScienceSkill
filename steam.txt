Are you tired of finding all these specimens, microscopes, and science magazines but having nothing useful to do with them? Same.

Introducing the Science skill - finally a reason to hoard all that nerdy stuff!

[h1]What does Science do?[/h1]

[b]Research Specimens[/b]
Found a jar with a brain in it? A dead rat? Some weird mushrooms? Now you can actually study them! Just find a microscope, plop your specimen nearby, and get that sweet, sweet Science XP.

Pro tip: Pay extra attention to plants, berries, and mushrooms. Rumor has it that studying enough of them might unlock something... useful. 👀

Look for the small gray "R" on item icons - that means you haven't read/researched it yet and it can give you Science XP!

[b]Faster Learning[/b]
Higher Science = faster skill book reading.
- Up to 50% faster at Science 10
- Also speeds up recipe research from items

[b]XP Boost[/b]
Science makes you smarter at everything (except punching zombies):
- +2% bonus to all non-combat XP per Science level
- That's +20% at max level.

[b]Electrical Synergy[/b]
- Gain Science XP when gaining Electrical XP (half amount)

[b]Medical Knowledge[/b]
- Bandages last longer (+5% per Science level)
- Faster medical treatments (bandaging, disinfecting, splinting)

[h1]How to level Science?[/h1]
- Read Science books and magazines (duh)
- Read SciFi books (small amount - it's fiction, but it inspires curiosity!)
- Read ANY skill book (tiny amount)
- Research specimens at a microscope
- Research recipes from items
- Do electrical stuff

[h1]Researchable Items[/h1]
Pretty much anything that looks sciency:
- Specimen jars (brain, insects, fetal animals, etc.)
- Dead critters (rats, mice, birds, squirrels)
- Insects, berries, mushrooms
- Medicinal plants
- Gems, crystals, minerals
- Medical equipment (first time studying it)
- And more!

[h1]Requirements[/h1]
- Game version 42.13+
- No other mods required

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
Should work with most mods. We hook into vanilla functions cleanly and call originals when possible.

Now go forth and science the apocalypse! 🔬🧪
